# Turtle Dot Painting

This project was created during my early days of learning Python. The code generates a simple dot painting using the Turtle library, with random colors extracted from an image.

## What This Code Does
- Extracts colors from an image file (JPEG) using the `colorgram` library.
- Draws a grid of colorful dots in random order.
- Uses the Turtle library to render the graphics on the screen.

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python (version 3.6 or higher) is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install colorgram.py
3. Place an image file (e.g., turtle-jpg.jpg) in the same directory as the script.
Run the script:
```bash
python dot_arts.py
```
## Project Purpose
This code demonstrates basic Python concepts, such as:

- Working with loops and functions.
- Interacting with libraries.
- Creating graphics with Turtle.

This is my first step in learning Python, and I welcome your feedback or suggestions for improvement!
